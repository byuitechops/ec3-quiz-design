            <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
            <p>Winter break is almost here! Please read this email carefully. There are some important announcements and reminders in this email.</p>
            <p>1. We will have a cleaning check on Saturday, January 21st after the break. We will send another email about this soon. The next email will have more information about the cleaning check.</p>
            <p>2. Will you have a guest staying with you during the break? Your guest needs to come to the office to fill out a form. This is important. Guests must do this before they stay at your apartment. If your guest does not come sign in with the Palm Apartment office, you may have to pay a fine.</p>
            <p>3. We know that some of you will be gone during the winter break. Remember that nobody can live in your apartment while you are gone.</p>
            <p>This means family, friends, and guests may not stay there if you are not there. It is against the rules.</p>
            <p>Thank you for everything that you do to make Palm Apartments great. Please tell us if there is anything we can do for you. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!</p>
