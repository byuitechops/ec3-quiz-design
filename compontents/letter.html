                <p>Dear Parents, It’s flu season again. I want to keep your children as healthy as possible. But I need your help. Do you know the difference between the symptoms of a cold and the flu? Cold symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A runny nose</li>
                    <li>A sore throat</li>
                    <li>Little or no fever</li>
                    <li>Sometimes a cough</li>
                    <li>Symptoms usually occur gradually (not suddenly) Flu symptoms include:</li>
                    <li>A runny nose</li>
                    <li>A sore throat</li>
                    <li>Extreme tiredness</li>
                    <li>Fever</li>
                    <li>Cough</li>
                    <li>Headache</li>
                    <li>Body aches</li>
                    <li>Symptoms often occur suddenly</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A cold and the flu have some symptoms in common. However, the flu is more serious than a cold. It can develop into more serious illnesses, such as pneumonia. For this reason, I ask that you keep your child home from school if he/she shows signs of the flu. This will stop the spread of the flu to other children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your help in this matter.</p>
                <p>
                    Sincerely, Joan Palison</p>
