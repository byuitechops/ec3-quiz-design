* Do we need the icons on the chat bubbles?
* Do we really want the chat bubbles to have the arrows pointed toward the center?
* How wide do we expect the page contents to be?
* Do we put the word "AD" above the advert components? -doc says yes, I just think it's weird
* Do you want the ribbons to be a set width?
* We need to have a discussion on the workings of "explaining/telling"
* Are you wanting re-usable classes that can apply to different components? For instance, I see "head" in a bunch of places and "block." Are these supposed to all be the same?
* Are the surveys pre-filled or user fillable?
* Are we expecting options for checking and unchecking the survey boxes?
