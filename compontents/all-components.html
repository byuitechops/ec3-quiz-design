        <div class="journal-body">
            <p>During my volunteer trip, my team and I met a woman named Gopi Bi.</p>
            <div class="journal-entry">
                <p>
                    As we approached Gopi Bi's home, I saw an older-looking woman in the front. “Who is this?” I thought to myself. “Surely it can’t be Gopi Bi. Perhaps her mother? An older sister?” But no - this was Gopi Bi herself. Only 45 years old, the harshness of her life had aged her significantly. We came to talk with her and accompany her as she went about her daily chores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her first chore was to fetch water. Five times a day she does this. And although the trip wasn't too far that day, she explained that when the community well dries up in the summer, she walks 5 km one way for this water. That's 50 km of walking. Per day. For water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She also prepared food for her family. I helped her prepare the food - ciabatta bread. This is bread made from nothing more than flour and water. She said that on better days, they also have potatoes and naan bread. She and her family have two meals per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later we went outside to do some repairs of her home. The walls are made from dirt, sticks, and cow dung. There are many leaks when it rains. After she had taught us to do it, we helped her patch up a few cracks. When she can, Gopi Bi also takes on additional work (beyond the running of her own household). She is paid less than 2.30 U.S. dollars per day for this extra work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gopi Bi showed incredible resilience. She openly discussed with us her life's high points and the challenging times. Although she is completely illiterate, she recognizes the importance of education. She does all she can to keep her youngest daughter in school. She cherishes the few moments when she can talk with the other women in her village. She also greatly enjoys festival days, which is when she can travel with her husband to see her family of origin.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>My experience with Gopi Bi was just one day. But I hope I never forget her.</p>

                <p>Dear Parents, It’s flu season again. I want to keep your children as healthy as possible. But I need your help. Do you know the difference between the symptoms of a cold and the flu? Cold symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A runny nose</li>
                    <li>A sore throat</li>
                    <li>Little or no fever</li>
                    <li>Sometimes a cough</li>
                    <li>Symptoms usually occur gradually (not suddenly) Flu symptoms include:</li>
                    <li>A runny nose</li>
                    <li>A sore throat</li>
                    <li>Extreme tiredness</li>
                    <li>Fever</li>
                    <li>Cough</li>

                    <li>Body aches</li>
                    <li>Symptoms often occur suddenly</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A cold and the flu have some symptoms in common. However, the flu is more serious than a cold. It can develop into more serious illnesses, such as pneumonia. For this reason, I ask that you keep your child home from school if he/she shows signs of the flu. This will stop the spread of the flu to other children.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="podcast-body">
                <p> Hi listeners. Welcome to Nomad Jake’s podcast. Today I’m going to talk about how to save money while on vacation. When you go on a trip, you want to get as much out of your vacation as you can while spending as little money as possible. To make your dollars stretch, I have compiled a list of tips for your next trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start off, driving yourself is often too expensive, so take public transportation and share rides. A private ride from the airport can be comfortable, but it can be costly. You should consider taking public transportation like the bus or a train. If public transportation is too confusing, try to find another person to split the cost of a taxi. And, don’t forget to walk as much as you can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, don’t eat near major tourist sites. Famous tourist attractions will usually have expensive eateries. Similar to eating at the airport or sporting venues, the food at tourist attractions is overpriced. One way to tell if you are getting a bad deal is if the menu is in multiple languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way of knowing is if the restaurant has many international locations. Save your money and enjoy the local culture by searching for places that the locals love. If locals frequently eat at a place, then that restaurant is usually reasonably priced and has excellent quality. I personally prefer authentic local cuisine because it is usually fresh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another suggestion is don’t be too cheap because you’ll pay for it. There are some conveniences that are worth a little extra money to save time or unnecessary effort. Walking is a great way to save money, but walking too much can waste time. For example, I suggest you spend the extra $5 - $10 to get a short taxi ride from one attraction to another, so that you can see more in one day before closing time. Spend that extra $50–100 on a flight if it is going to save you a day in travel time. Time is just as valuable as your budget. You don’t want to waste your money, but don’t waste your time either.
                </p>
                <p>

                    My last tip is to choose free activities. Although I just recommended you spend some additional money to save time, saving money is the main priority. The best way to save money is to enjoy free activities. Many festivals, fairs, parades and other cultural celebrations are free if you happen to go at the right time of year. Some other free activities include parks, beaches and shopping centers. Additionally, some museums, historical landmarks, and other famous attractions have days with free admission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you follow these tips, I assure you that you will have a better vacation. It’s important to plan well enough so that you can take advantage of the many unique attractions at each destination. I’ve spent too much on a trip before because of poor planning. You don’t want to spend hard earned money and then get to your destination and feel like you can’t afford it.

            <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
            <p>Winter break is almost here! Please read this email carefully. There are some important announcements and reminders in this email.</p>
            <p>1. We will have a cleaning check on Saturday, January 21st after the break. We will send another email about this soon. The next email will have more information about the cleaning check.</p>
            <p>2. Will you have a guest staying with you during the break? Your guest needs to come to the office to fill out a form. This is important. Guests must do this before they stay at your apartment. If your guest does not come sign in with the Palm Apartment office, you may have to pay a fine.</p>
            <p>3. We know that some of you will be gone during the winter break. Remember that nobody can live in your apartment while you are gone.</p>
            <p>This means family, friends, and guests may not stay there if you are not there. It is against the rules.</p>
            <p>Thank you for everything that you do to make Palm Apartments great. Please tell us if there is anything we can do for you. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!</p>

        <p> Only a few days before New Year’s! It’s a time for new goals. For me, I’d like to improve
my sleep schedule. I have a terrible habit of waking up late.
                </p><p>
As a freelance writer, I don't have to get up early. I can work whenever I want. So I can
sleep until 11 am, right? I used to think that. But I’ve learned that when I get up late, I
don't have a very productive day.
                </p><p>
Why does waking up late affect my whole day? Getting up in the morning is actually my
first decision for the day. If I make the choice to get up early, I set a pattern of
self-discipline for the day. I am more productive at work. I get more accomplished
around the house. I feel better about myself. On the other hand, when I choose to sleep
in, I set a pattern of less self-discipline for that day. I have a lazier attitude. I get less
done.
                </p><p>
You can help me with my New Year’s resolution to wake up earlier. How? Comment on
this post and ask me how I’m doing with my goal. Habits can be hard to change alone.
Help me be accountable for my decision to make a change.
                </p><p>
And please, comment and share your New Year's resolution! Do you want to exercise
more, learn a new skill, or strengthen a friendship? Telling others about your goal is a
great first step!origin.</p>
