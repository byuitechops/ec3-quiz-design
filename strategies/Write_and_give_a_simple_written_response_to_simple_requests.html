                <p>Requests are questions used to ask others to do thing. Requests usually begin with one of the following word groups:<em>Will you, Would you, Can you, Could you. Polite requests usually begin with would and could.</em></p>
                <br>
                <p>Answers to requests are either “yes” or no”, or words similar to yes or no. They often repeat word from the offer. Here are some examples:</p>
                <p> Yes, I can</p>
                <p>Yeah</p>
                <p>Sure</p>
                <p>No, I can't</p>
