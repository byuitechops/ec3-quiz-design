                <p>When giving a compliment, we usually say something nice about a person or thing and then ask a question about it, such as where it was bought, or how it was made.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We usually reply to a compliment in one of two ways: accepting it or rejecting it. When accepting a compliment, we usually thank the person and then either explain something about the the thing or about ourselves or give a similar compliment back. When rejecting a compliment, we still thank the person, but then say something to deny the compliment.</p>
