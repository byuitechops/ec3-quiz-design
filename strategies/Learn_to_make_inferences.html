                <p>Making an inference means you use the information you understand and know to make conclusions about information you don’t know.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For example, if your friend comes into class wearing a coat and carrying an umbrella, you can make an inference: it is probably cold and wet outside. You know this about the weather even if your friend does not tell you. You used the information you know (coat, umbrella) to make the conclusion that the weather is cold and wet. This is an inference.</p>

                    <p>From this information, we can infer (guess/ conclude) that John's favorite food is pizza. He did not say it was his favorite food. But the things he said make it easy to guess that pizza is his favorite food.</p>
