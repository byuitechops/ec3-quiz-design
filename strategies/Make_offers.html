                <p>Make an offer by asking someone if you can help. Most of the time offers are written or spoken as questions with the following phrases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Can I</em></li>
                    <li><em>Shall I</em></li>
                    <li><em>Would you like</em></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Sometimes they are simple statements. Many times these statements are responses to general requests.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em> I will do the cleaning.</em></li>
                    <li><em>I can take you to school.</em></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> To: Kenneth, Jenna, Jack, Frank</li>
                        <li> Liz: Hey, I’m planning Tracy’s birthday party. Can any of you bring anything?</li>
                        <li> Kenneth: Sure thing. <em>I’ve got drinks.</em></li>
                        <li> Jenna: Totally.<em>I’ll bring cake.</em></li>
                        <li> Frank:<em>Count me in for the music</em></li>
                        <li> Jack: I won’t be able to make it. I’ve got a meeting that day.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                <p>In this example, Liz makes a general request for Tracy’s birthday party: “Can any of you bring anything?” In response to her request, there are three different offers: 1.) <em>I’ve got drinks,</em> 2.) <em>I’ll bring cake,</em> and 3.) <em>Count me in for music.</em>Notice that all of these offers to help are simple statements, not questions.</p>
