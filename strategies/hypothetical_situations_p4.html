                <p>“Hypothetical” describes something that is not real, but is possible. For example, it is possible to eat a taco tomorrow. It is not sure that you will eat a taco tomorrow. But it is possible. This is a hypothetical situation. We use conditional verb tenses for hypothetical situations. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Some hypothetical situations are in the past. They did not happen in the past, but they were possible. For example, it was possible for you to eat a taco yesterday. You did not eat a taco. But it was possible. This is hypothetical because it is not real. It is also in the past. For hypothetical situations that were possible in the past, but did not happen, use past perfect and present perfect tenses, with a modal (<em>would</em> or <em>could</em>): </p>
