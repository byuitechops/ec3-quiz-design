            <p>A comma (,) is a punctuation mark. It helps join or separate ideas in one sentence. This lesson will explain three common ways to use commas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a comma in a list of two or more nouns</li>
                <li>Use a comma to join two independent clauses when they are joined by "and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet."</li>
                <li>Use a comma after an introductory phrase or adverb.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Avoid using run-on sentences (sentences that are too long) or comma splices (commas where a period should be). Use a period instead of a comma if there are two independent clauses.</p>
