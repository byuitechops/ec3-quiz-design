                <p>Compare means to find <u>similarities</u> between two or more people, ideas, events, or things. Contrast means to find <u>differences</u> between two or more people, ideas, events, or things. We compare and contrast for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To gain a deeper understanding of the items we are comparing.</li>
                    <li>To see the relationship among the items we are comparing.</li>
                    <li>To discover what is the best, most preferred, or most desirable about the items we are comparing.</li>
                    <li>To make a decision when we have a choice between one or more possible actions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The purpose of comparing and contrasting is not just to point out similarities and differences. The purpose is to increase understanding or appreciation or show something unexpected.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Review the sentences below.</p>
               <ol>
                   <li>Eating out and cooking at home have similarities and differences. </li>
                   <li>Eating out is more expensive than cooking at home</li>
                   <li>Cooking at home is better than eating out.</li>
                   <li>Eating out is more fun than cooking at home.</li>
               </ol>
               <p>The first sentence does not state a purpose. The other sentences have a clear purpose.</p>
                <p>Below are some examples of situations in daily life in which we might compare and contrast.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Which movie should we see tonight?</p>
                <div class="aside">
                    <p>The comedy is supposed to be very good, but love stories are my favorite. I’ve heard the acting is better in the love story, too. Sometimes comedies have bad jokes or the actors use bad language. Love stories can have in bad parts, too. It’s very hard to choose a good movie. Maybe we should stay home and play a game instead.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Should I read the scriptures in the morning or at night?</p>
                <div class="aside">
                    <p>I prefer to read the scriptures is in the morning. In the morning, my head is clear and I am well-rested. I can feel the spirit. At night, I may be tired and want to go to sleep. I might be thinking about all the problems I have had at work. My houses might be full of noise. For me, the morning is the best time to study the scriptures.</p>
                </div>
            </div>         
            <h2 class="flag blue-flag blue">Practice</h2>
            <div class="callout light-blue">
                <p>Discuss the topics above, the topics above, or a topic of your choice with a friend or family member.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Which cell phone should I buy?</p>
                <p>Is it better to buy a used car or a new car?</p>
                <p>Should I study online or in a traditional classroom?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Write a short paragraph comparing or contrasting two movies, two phones, or a topic of your choice. Review the strategies about main ideas to find out how to write main idea sentence for your paragraph. Make sure you state a clear purpose in your main idea sentence.</p>
