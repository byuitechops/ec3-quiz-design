                <p>“Hypothetical” describes something that is not real, but is possible. For example, it is possible to eat a taco tomorrow. It is not sure that you will eat a taco tomorrow. But it is possible. This is a hypothetical situation. We use conditional verb tenses for hypothetical situations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some hypothetical situations are usually true when they happen. For example, if you don’t brush your teeth, you get cavities. This is hypothetical because it is not happening right now, so it is not real. But it is usually true when it happens. For hypothetical situations that are usually true, use simple present tense sentences.</p>
