            <p>Sometimes, we think other people’s ideas are true. Sometimes, we think other people’s ideas are not true. When we think other people’s ideas are true, we agree with their ideas. When we think other people’s ideas are not true, we disagree with their ideas.</p>

            <p>For example, your friend says that chocolate tastes bad. You do not think this is true. You think chocolate tastes
                good. This means you disagree with your friend. But if you also think chocolate tastes bad, then you agree
