                <p>“Hypothetical” describes something that is not real, but is possible. For example, it is possible to eat a taco tomorrow. It is not sure that you will eat a taco tomorrow. But it is possible. This is a hypothetical situation. We use conditional verb tenses for hypothetical situations.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <p>Some hypothetical situations will probably or likely be true if they happen. It is not sure that they will be true, but they probably will be. For example, if you rest, you will feel better. This is hypothetical because you are not resting right now, so it is not real. But you will probably or likely feel better if you rest. For hypothetical situations that are probably or likely true, use simple present tense and future tense.</p>
