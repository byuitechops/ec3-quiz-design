                <p>You will find new words as you read and listen. Do not stop to translate every new word you find. Good language learners focus on the information that they understand, and use it to make an inference (a conclusion or a guess) about the meaning of new words.</p>

                    <p>Jen: My kids<strong>misbehaved</strong>today, Jane. They made a big mess, they broke the window, and they were unkind to their grandma!</p>

                <p>Jane does not know what “misbehaved” means. But Jane understands that making messes, breaking things, and being unkind are bad things to do. She makes an inference, and concludes that “misbehaved” means doing bad things.</p>
