                <p>Report a problem when you want someone to fix something.  Try to be polite and apologize even though it is not your fault. You can get the attention of someone by saying “excuse me” or “sorry.” Usually, the person will work to fix the problem. Be prepared with information about the problem.  This includes dates, numbers, and names of people you have talked to.</p>
