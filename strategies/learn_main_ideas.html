                <p>A paragraph is a group of sentences that talks about a single idea. This idea is called the main idea. The main idea is often found in the first sentence of a paragraph. It tells you what a paragraph is about. It is the most important thought about the topic. The sentence that contains the main idea is called a topic sentence. Finding the main ideas in a reading passage will help you become a better reader. You will also need to learn to write main idea sentences of your own.</p>

                            <li>Most people enjoy going out to eat. It is a nice change from making meals at home. People can relax and enjoy themselves. They can visit with friends and family while someone else prepares their food. They don’t have to clean up. They can also choose from a variety of items. They can taste new dishes or order favorite ones. Sometime they can even taste the food that their friends order. Almost everyone enjoys a meal in a restaurant or café.</li>
                            <li>Preparing meals at home can be very satisfying. You can decide what to make—a favorite family dish or something completely new. You can buy fresh ingredients. You can make the dish exactly the way you want. For example, if the recipe includes mushrooms, but you don’t like mushrooms, you can leave them out. You can also substitute ingredients, or use different ingredients from what is in the recipe. The best part of making meals at home is when your spouse or children say, “This is delicious.” “Can I please have more?” Then you feel really happy that you prepared a meal for your family.</li>

                            <li>_________________________________________________ . The temperature is cool. The air is fresh. The weather is getting colder, but some of the warmth of summer remains. The leaves turn many vibrant colors. They are gold, red, yellow, and brown, making the streets and hillsides very colorful. The leaves fall on the ground and make crunchy sounds when you walk on them. I love being outside during the fall.</li>
                            <li>_________________________________________________ . Every Saturday, I clean my house. I vacuum the floors, clean the bathrooms, and dust the furniture. When I clean the bathrooms, I put out clean towels and sometimes I wash the shower curtain. I make sure everything is neat and tidy all over the house by picking up toys or magazines or games. Sometimes I wash the windows, or clean out cupboards or drawers in the kitchen, but not every week.</li>
