                <p>English has many ways to ask questions. Some are simple and some are complicated.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One complicated question type is statement questions. Statement questions are formed the same way sentences are, but they have a question mark at the end in writing, and our voices go up at the end in speaking.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We use statement questions for two reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>To show we are surprised.</strong> For example, if you bought a new car, and I was surprised, I would say 
                            “You bought a new car?”</li>
                    <li><strong>To show we don’t believe something.</strong> For example, if the team usually loses all the games, and you say the team won a game, I would say
                            “They won the game?”</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>Form statement questions in this way:</p>
                <div class="aside">
                    <p><ul>subject + verb + object?</ul></p>
                    <p>You ate all the candy?</p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="text-pink">Vocabulary</h3>
                <div class="aside">
                    <p><strong>Subject: </strong><em>person/thing creating the action in a sentence.</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Verb: </strong><em>the action in a sentence.</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Object: </strong><em>person/thing receiving the action in a sentence. </em></p>
