                <p>English has many ways to ask questions. Some are simple and some are complicated. One complicated question type is statement questions. Statement questions are formed the same way sentences are, but they have a question mark at the end in writing. Our voices go up at the end in speaking.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We use statement questions for two reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>To show we are surprised.</strong> For example, if you bought a new car, and I was surprised, I would say 
                            “You bought a new car?”</li>
                    <li><strong>To show we don’t believe something.</strong> For example, I was suprised your team won the game. I would say, "You won the game?"
                            “You won the game?”</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Form statement questions in this way:</p>
                <div class="aside">
                    <p>subject + verb + object?</p>
                    <p>You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the candy?</p>
