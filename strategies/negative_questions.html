                <p>English has many ways to ask questions. Some are simple and some are complicated.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One complicated question type is negative questions.Negative questions do not say negative things. They use negative phrases in them (not, don’t, aren’t). For example, “Don’t you want to go?” This question does not ask something negative. It asks if you want to go. But it uses the negative phrase “don’t.” So it is a negative question. </p>
                <p>Negative questions are used for two reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>To confirm something you think is true.</strong> For example, I think you want to eat pizza. But I am not sure. Can i ask you "Don't you want to eat pizza?"</li>
                    <li><strong>To express opinions politely.</strong> For example, I thin kpizza is better than spaghettie. But you think is spaghetti is better than pizza. I want to be polite. So I say "Isn't pizza better than spaghetti?"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Form negative questions in this way:</p>
                <div class="aside">
                    <p><u>Auxillary + n't + subject + verb + object</u></p>
                    <p>     Are       n't     you    going   home?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="aside">
                    <p><strong>Confirm: </strong><em>to become sure that something you  believe is true is actually true</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Negative: </strong><em>in grammar, negative means words that have "not" in them. For example, doesn't isn't, hasn't, won't, etc</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Polite: </strong><em>respectful actions and manners</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Auxillary: </strong><em>words that add to the meaning of verbs. For example, can, will, do</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Subject: </strong><em>person/thing creating the action in a sentence</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Verb: </strong><em>the action in a sentence</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Object: </strong><em>person/thing receiving the action in a sentence</em></p>
