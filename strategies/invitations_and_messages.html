                <p>Almost every day people ask you to do things. Sometimes they ask you to help them. This is a request. Sometimes they just want to do something with you (eat food, go to a film, go to the park, etc.). This is an invitation. To make these invitations, people usually use simple written messages. It is important to know what these simple messages look like.</p>
