                <p>English has many ways to ask questions. Some are simple and some are complicated.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One complicated question type is indirect questions. We use indirect questions to be polite or formal. For example, if I am at an expensive restaurant, and I need to use the bathroom, I use an indirect question like “Could you please tell me where the bathroom is?”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Form indirect questions by using an indirect question phrase, and then adding the rest of the question after the phrase.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Indirect question phrases: </p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Could you (please) tell me...</li>
                            <li>Do you know...</li>
                            <li>I was wondering...</li>
                            <li>Do you have any idea...</li>
                            <li>I'd like to know...</li>
                            <li>Would it be possible...</li>
                            <li>Is there any chance... </li>
