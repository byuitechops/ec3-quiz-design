               <p>Sometimes you need to make a reservation to hold a hotel room, get a plane or train ticket, schedule a taxi, or save a table at a restaurant. You need to prepare your travel information in advance including dates and times you will leave and arrive. You also need to know how many people are in your group or party and the ages of children. You should be prepared to explain any medical conditions or allergies. Reservations are mostly made online, but sometimes you need to call the company.</p>
