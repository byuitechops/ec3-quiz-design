                <p>“Hypothetical” describes something that is not real, but is possible. For example, it is possible to eat a taco tomorrow. It is not sure that you will eat a taco tomorrow. But it is possible. This is a hypothetical situation. We use conditional verb tenses for hypothetical situations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some hypothetical situations are unlikely or unrealistic. It is possible for them to be true, but they probably never will be. For example, if you went to the moon, you would see the stars. This is hypothetical because it is not real. It is possible, but it probably will never be true. It is very unlikely and unrealistic. For hypothetical situations that are unlikely or unrealistic, use simple past tense and a modal (would or could):</p>
                <p><u>Hypothetical, unlikely or unrealistic:</u></p>
                <p><strong><em>If</em> + subject + verb-ed + Object, <em>then</em> + subject + modal + verb + object.</strong></p>
                <p>If you walked 100 miles, then you would be tired.</p>
