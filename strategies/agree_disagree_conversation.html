            <p>Sometimes we agree with people and sometimes we disagree. It is alright to disagree, but we should be polite.
                Also, the way we say something-the tone of our voice-shows how we feel. We can also disagree with someone in writing - this is called argumentative or persuasive writing. We often express
                opinions in both writing and speaking.</p>
